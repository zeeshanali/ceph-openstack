# ceph-openstack
Configuration and useful scripts for Ceph and Openstack integration 
I am using ceph as a de-facto backend for Openstack. 

What it means is that it is used for 

**Volumes (backend for cinder)** , 

**Images (backend for Glance)** and 

**VMs (backend for nova-compute)** .

This repository will share some of my notes and important **configuration** needed to make this happen.
